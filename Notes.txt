#Chapter 6

@Performance By Period
(pp141)
performance statistics year-by-year (table 6.4) 

@Standard Error
(pp160)
Standard Error = Standard Deviation/Square Root of the Sample Size
AWt   = Average Win
StDev = Standard Deviation
SqRt  = Square Root
Nwt   = Number of Winning Trades
StandardError = StDev(AWt)/SqRt(Nwt)
>The larger the sample, the smaller the standard error
>The smaller the standard deviation, the more stable 

Standard Deviation = Sqrt(Variance)
Variance = Mean(SQ(Sample-Mean)) (if sample divide by n-1, if population divide by n)

@Degrees of Freedom
DF    = Degrees of Freedom
Udf   = Used Degrees of Freedom (test window size) 
(for each indicator Do Udf = Udf + (unique?indicator windowsize:0(pp326)) + 1)
(for each trading-rule Do Udf = Udf + 1)

Odf   = Original Degrees of Freedom (number of data points)
Rdf%  = Remaining Percentage of Degrees of Freedom
Rdf   = 100 × [1 − (Udf/Odf)]
Rdf   = 100 × [1 − (30/100)]
Rdf   = 70%
>less than 90 percent remaining degrees of freedom is considered too few

Freedom
1. Use a large enough test sample
2. Allow for start-up overhead
3. Do not overparameterize the strategy
4. Be sure the range of parameter scans is strategy and sample appropriate
5. Test with degrees of freedom of at least 90 percent remaining whenever possible

@Trade Sample Size
> 30 - 50 Trades is an adequate minimum 

@Standard Error of Trade Sample Size 
Std Err = 1 / Sqrt (# of Trades)

@Trading window
1/8 or 1/3 of test window size
>shorter trade window, more profitable, more frequent reoptimization
>longer trade window, less responsice, more adaptable to large shifts in trend

@Test Window Size 
at least five year (daily:1825 points)

@Number of Trades 
at least 30 
> the more trades, the better, best defence against overfitting

@Optimization Profile
> at least 20 percent of test should result in profit


#Chapter 11
WALK FORWARD ANALYSIS

@Walk-Forward Efficeny
> robust strategies have WFE >= %50-%60
(chp13)
WFE = Annualized profit of WFA / Annualized profit of Optimization

@Shelf-life of parameter set 
identified by the test window of WFA

@Walk-Forward Window (trading window)
%25 to 35 percent of optimization window

@Walk-Forward Report 
(pp240)

@Annualized RRR

@MDD 
> if MDD of WFA exceeds MDD of optimization MDD, then TROUBLE!


#Chapter 12
The Evaluation of Performance 

@Annualized Reward-to-Risk Ratio (RRR)
  RRR   = Net Profit     / MDD
Ann RRR = Ann Net Profit / MDD
> the bigger the RRR the better. should be three or better

@Maximum Run-Up (MRU)
largest improvement in trading equity between an equity low and a subsequent equity
high

@Risk Adjusted Return (RAR) 
> higher percentage, better performance
RAR increases if the rate of profit increases but the risk remains the same. 
RAR can also increase however, if the rate of profit remains the same and if risk is decreased.
Annualized RAR = Annualized Profit / Required Capital (RC)
                                                       RC = Margin + Risk 
                                                                     Risk = MDD * Safety factor 
                                                                     
@Model Efficiency
ME = ( Net Profit / Perfect Profit ) (percentage)

@Consistency 
Evaluate average, std dev., max, min for each (adjusted)
- Profit,Loss; Winning and Losing Trades; Winning and Losing Runs; Long and Short Trades

@Patterns of Profit and Loss
Evaluate performance distribution on yearly profit & loss with drawdown 
> higher profit (trend up), lower MDD (trend down) 
> the more even the distribution, the better, and the more distant the maximum drawdown, the better
