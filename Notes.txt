@Performance By Period
(pp141)
performance statistics year-by-year (table 6.4) 

@Standard Error
(pp160)
Standard Error = Standard Deviation/Square Root of the Sample Size
AWt   = Average Win
StDev = Standard Deviation
SqRt  = Square Root
Nwt   = Number of Winning Trades
StandardError = StDev(AWt)/SqRt(Nwt)
>The larger the sample, the smaller the standard error
>The smaller the standard deviation, the more stable 

Standard Deviation = Sqrt(Variance)
Variance = Mean(SQ(Sample-Mean)) (if sample divide by n-1, if population divide by n)

@Degrees of Freedom
DF    = Degrees of Freedom
Udf   = Used Degrees of Freedom (test window size) 
(for each indicator Do Udf = Udf + indicator windowsize + 1)
(for each trading-rule Do Udf = Udf + 1)

Odf   = Original Degrees of Freedom (number of data points)
Rdf%  = Remaining Percentage of Degrees of Freedom
Rdf   = 100 × [1 − (Udf/Odf)]
Rdf   = 100 × [1 − (30/100)]
Rdf   = 70%
>less than 90 percent remaining degrees of freedom is considered too few

@Trading window
1/8 or 1/3 of test window size
>shorter trade window, more profitable, more frequent reoptimization
>longer trade window, less responsice, more adaptable to large shifts in trend

@Test Window Size 
at least five year (daily:1825 points)

@Number of Trades 
at least 30 
> the more trades, the better, best defence against overfitting

@Optimization Profile
> at least 20 percent of test should result in profit
