@Performance By Period
(pp141)
performance statistics year-by-year (table 6.4) 



@Standard Error
(pp160)
Standard Error = Standard Deviation/Square Root of the Sample Size
AWt   = Average Win
StDev = Standard Deviation
SqRt  = Square Root
Nwt   = Number of Winning Trades
StandardError = StDev(AWt)/SqRt(Nwt)
>The larger the sample, the smaller the standard error
>The smaller the standard deviation, the more stable 

Standard Deviation = Sqrt(Variance)
Variance = Mean(SQ(Sample-Mean)) (if sample divide by n-1, if population divide by n)

@Degrees of Freedom
